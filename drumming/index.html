<h3>Hannah's Intro to Drumming</h3>
	  <p>In the summer of 2025, I, Hannah Hijjawi, went to a music camp in California. 
		  I didn't think much of it, but I signed up for drumming because I wanted to try something completely new. 
		  When I entered the music room and sat down at one of the many kits, it felt scary and new. 
		  But, as I started learning and playing almost everyday, playing the instrument came very easily to me. 
		  When I got back home, I immediately asked my parents for an electric kit and after a bit of convincing, I had my very first drumming set. 
		  It wasn't an acoustic but it was still amazing to be on the drums again. 
		  As my birthday started to creep up, my father told me that if I practiced everyday up until then, he would buy me an acoustic kit.
		  Thankfully, it was an easy task, because drumming was and is so much fun for me and helps me when I feel stressed out.
		  I got my first acoustic kit for my 15th birthday, and it was the best gift I could've asked for.
		  Ever since then, I have been practicing everyday.</p>
